# Predicting-heart-disease-using-maching-learning
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict wheather or not they have heart disease.
This notebook looks into using various python-based maching learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wheather or not someone has disease based on their medical attributes.
we're going to take the following approach: Problem defination, Data Evaluation, Features Modelling & Experimentation
